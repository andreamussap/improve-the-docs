As part of API Gateway policy execution, the API Gateway needs to
interact with various components of the existing infrastructure. For
example, these include external connections to systems such as
databases, LDAP servers, third-party identity management products, and
so on. This topic describes how the API Gateway interacts with these
components in your existing network infrastructure.

Databases
---------

API Gateway interoperates with a range of commonly used databases for a
wide variety of purposes. For example, this includes managing access
control credentials, authorization attributes, identity and role
information, monitoring metrics, and reporting. API Gateway uses Java
Database Connectivity (JDBC) to manage database connections. The
following databases are supported:

-   MySQL
-   Oracle
-   DB2
-   Microsoft SQL Server
-   MariaDB

API Gateway also supports Apache Cassandra for internal data storage.

For details on supported database versions, see the [API Gateway
Installation
Guide](/bundle/APIGateway_77_InstallationGuide_allOS_en_HTML5/) .

Anti-virus
----------

API Gateway supports Anti-Virus (AV) scanning using virus scanning
engines from third-party vendors such as McAfee, Sophos, and ClamAV.
Depending on the engine, this scanning can happen in-process or remotely
using a client SDK or Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP). The
API Gateway takes message attachments, passes them to the AV scanner,
and then acts on the decision. The following conditions apply:

-   AV signature distribution and updates are performed using mechanisms
    of the anti-virus vendor.
-   Licensing for the AV engine is performed through the AV vendor
    distribution channels.

For more details, see the [API Gateway Policy Developer
Guide](/bundle/APIGateway_77_PolicyDevGuide_allOS_en_HTML5/) .

Operations and management
-------------------------

API Gateway has a number of different options for operations and
management:

-   Detailed transaction logs can be sent to syslog (UDP), relational
    databases, or flat files. These contain detailed records of
    processed messages, their contents, how long processing took, and
    decisions taken during message processing. This type of logging can
    also include information alerts about policy execution failures and
    breached Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and information about
    critical events such as connection or disk failures. Logging levels
    can be controlled for an API Gateway or policy as a whole or on a
    filter-by-filter basis.
-   Auditing information can be viewed in real time in the API Gateway
    Manager console, and can be pushed to your metrics database (for
    example, for monitoring in API Gateway Analytics, API Manager, or a
    third-party tool), or pushed to Embedded Analytics dashboards. For
    more details on logging, see [Troubleshoot your API Gateway
    installation](part_8_troubleshoot.htm).
-   The API Gateway Manager console is used to provide a current
    snapshot of how the API Gateway is behaving. For example, it
    displays how many messages are being processed, and what services
    are under the most load. API Gateway Manager displays what is
    happening now on API Gateway instances, and can be viewed by
    pointing a browser at an Admin Node Manager. For more details, see
    [Monitor services in API Gateway Manager](monitor_service.htm).
-   Flexible alerts can be sent out to email, SNMP, OPSEC, syslog,
    Twitter, and Windows Event Log based on a condition being met in a
    policy. An example might be to email a service owner for every 1000
    failures or to generate an alert if a service is processing more
    than 10000 messages per second. They can also be used to generate
    alerts on client usage. For more details, see the [API Gateway
    Policy Developer
    Guide](/bundle/APIGateway_77_PolicyDevGuide_allOS_en_HTML5/) .
-   Service Level Agreement filters can be used to perform a statistical
    measure of the services quality of service. They are used to make
    sure that the amount of network connection errors, response times
    and server errors are below a certain threshold. For more details,
    see the [API Gateway Policy Developer
    Guide](/bundle/APIGateway_77_PolicyDevGuide_allOS_en_HTML5/) .

Network firewalls
-----------------

When deployed in a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) or perimeter network, the
API Gateway sits behind network firewalls. Network Address Translation
(NAT) firewall functionality is used on the network firewall to provide
the API Gateway with a publicly routable address in the DMZ. This allows
the API Gateway to route traffic internally to a local IP address range.
API Gateways may be dual-homed to pass messages between the DMZ and the
internal trusted network.

The API Gateway can then perform security processing on the incoming
message traffic. For example, this includes the following:

-   Looking for known attack patterns.
-   Checking the validity and structure of the message for anomalies.
-   Looking for traffic patterns that suggest a Denial-of-Service (DoS)
    attack.

### Advantages over traditional application firewalls

API Gateways have a number of advantages over traditional application
firewalls for message processing: If an attack or unusual traffic
pattern is detected, the API Gateway can notify the firewall to block
the traffic at source using OPSEC or some other notification mechanism.

-   Can understand the structure of the traffic, and can detect subtle
    attack mechanisms such as entity expansion attacks and external
    reference attacks.
-   Can consume information in the messages such as security and
    platform-specific tokens.
-   Can use well understood standards such as JSON or XML Schema, JSON
    Path or XPath, WSDL, and OAuth to properly content filter the
    traffic.

### Firewall modes

You can configure the API Gateway to act as a network endpoint or a
network proxy, or both in tandem.

-   Block unidentified traffic. This is the default setting. If there is
    no policy configured for this traffic, block it and, depending on
    configuration, raise an alert. In this way, rogue message traffic is
    detected and blocked.
-   Pass unidentified traffic.

Application servers
-------------------

Application servers are the infrastructure alongside which API Gateways
are most commonly deployed. For example, API Gateways are often deployed
in production systems with IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic Server,
Microsoft Biztalk Server, Fiorano SOA Platform, TIBCO ActiveMatrix
BusinessWorks, and many others.

API Gateways interact with application servers in a number of modes, for
example: For increased integration with such application server systems,
the API Gateway supports numerous transport protocols including HTTP,
HTTPS, JMS, email (SMTP/POP), FTP, and so on.

-   Intercepting application server traffic by acting as a proxy.
-   Offloading processing handed over by the application server (for
    example, to offload message transformation, encryption, or signature
    validation).

Enterprise Service Buses
------------------------

API Gateways and Enterprise Service Buses (ESBs) have similar
functionality and complement each other very well. Example ESB systems
include Oracle Enterprise Service Bus, IBM WebSphere ESB, Progress Sonic
ESB, Software AG WebMethods, and JBoss ESB. API Gateways are primarily
used to perform the following tasks:

-   Protect ESBs and downstream systems from traffic surge, potential
    DoS attacks, and threats.
-   Offload expensive operations such as message validation and
    cryptography operations from ESBs.

### Similarities between API Gateways and ESBs

API Gateways and ESBs typically both perform the following tasks:

-   Protocol mediation
-   Message routing and transformation
-   Service composition
-   Message processing

### Differences between API Gateways and ESBs

The main differences between API Gateways and ESBs are as follows:

-   API Gateways can be used for simple composite services (chained),
    but do not support Business Process Execution Language (BPEL), and
    are not suitable for long duration composite services.
-   ESBs are usually delivered with backend adapters for systems such as
    CICS, IMS, Siebel, or SAP.
-   API Gateways are stateless and cannot maintain transaction state.
-   API Gateways are targeted at performance and application
    acceleration.
-   API Gateways have been designed to provide superior security
    capabilities, without impacting on performance.

Directories and user stores
---------------------------

API Gateway supports a wide variety of user stores including LDAP,
Active Directory, and access control products such as CA SiteMinder and
Oracle Access Manager. User stores contain some of the most valuable
information in an organization. For example, this includes private
identity information such as phone numbers, addresses, email addresses,
medical plan IDs, user names and passwords, certificates, organization
structures, and so on. API Gateways must be able to interact with user
stores without compromising them.

The API Gateway can use LDAP directories to retrieve user information
such as the following:

-   Authentication using username/password.
-   Retrieve certificates and checking signatures.
-   Authorization of clients based on attribute values.
-   Retrieval of attributes for placing into SAML assertions.
-   Checking certificate validity using Certificate Revocation Lists
    (CRL) retrieved from user stores.

For more details on integration with LDAP servers, see the [API Gateway
Policy Developer
Guide](/bundle/APIGateway_77_PolicyDevGuide_allOS_en_HTML5/) .

### Simple inline user store deployment

The following diagram shows a simple inline user store deployment:

![Inline user store deployment
(DMZ)](../Resources/Images/docbook/images/admin/admin_inline_user_store.png "Inline user store deployment (DMZ)"){.maxWidth}

#### Advantages

This architecture has the following advantages:

-   This is simple and easy to set up.
-   There is a single entry point through the DMZ for all message
    traffic.
-   This is the least expensive option.

#### Disadvantages

This architecture has the following disadvantages:

-   Exposing important user information in the DMZ is a potential
    security risk.
-   The LDAP server is only being used for external traffic.

API Gateway in DMZâLDAP in LAN
------------------------------

This is a very common setup where the API Gateway is located in the DMZ,
and where it communicates with a user store located in the LAN:

![User store in
LAN](../Resources/Images/docbook/images/admin/admin_internal_user_store.png "User store in LAN"){.maxWidth}

#### Advantages

This architecture has the following advantages:

-   The user store is protected from external access.
-   This option is only moderately expensive.

#### Disadvantages

This architecture has the following disadvantages:

-   Administrators must maintain two entry points into the LAN from the
    DMZ for a single application.
-   The user store is addressable from the DMZ, which is contrary to the
    security policies enforced by many organizations.

### Split deployment between DMZ and LAN

In this scenario, two API Gateways are used to split the security checks
across the DMZ and the LAN. For example, threats and JSON and XML schema
validity are performed in the DMZ, while authentication and/or
authorization is performed in the LAN:

![User store split
deployment](../Resources/Images/docbook/images/admin/admin_split_user_store.png "User store split deployment"){.maxWidth}

#### Advantages

This architecture has the following advantage:

-   This is the most secure deployment available.
-   By separating threats from access control, it is easy to run
    separate security policies for internal and external traffic.

#### Disadvantages

This architecture has the following disadvantages:

-   This is a more expensive option involving multiple API Gateways.

Access control
--------------

API Gateway interoperates with third-party Access Control and Identity
Management products at a number of different levels. For example:

![Example access control
options](../Resources/Images/docbook/images/admin/admin_access_control.png "Example access control options"){.maxWidth}

The options shown in the diagram are described as follows:

-   API Gateway can directly connect into the Identity Management system
    as an agent. This solution is currently available for third-party
    products such as Oracle Access Manager, Oracle Entitlements Server,
    RSA Access Manager, CA SiteMinder, and IBM Tivoli Access Manager.
    The Identity Management policy is defined in the Identity Management
    product to which the API Gateway delegates the authentication and
    authorization.
-   API Gateway can connect to the Identity Manager using the XML Access
    Control Markup Language (XACML) and Security Assertion Markup
    Language (SAML) protocols. API Gateway can request an authorization
    decision from a SAML Policy Decision Point (PDP) for an
    authenticated client using the SAML Protocol (SAMLP), which is
    defined in XACML. In such cases, the API Gateway presents evidence
    to the PDP in the form of user credentials, such as the
    Distinguished Name of a client X.509 certificate, or a
    username/password combination.
-   The PDP decides whether a user is authorized to access the requested
    resource. It then creates an authorization assertion, signs it, and
    returns it to the API Gateway in a SAMLP response. The API Gateway
    can then perform a number of checks on the response, such as
    validating the PDP signature and certificate, and examining the
    assertion. It can also insert the SAML authorization assertion into
    the message for consumption by a downstream service. This enables
    propagation of the access control decision to occur.

Public Key Infrastructure
-------------------------

API Gateway supports Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer
Security (TLS) for transport-based authentication, encryption, and
integrity checks. The API Gateway can interact with Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI) systems in the following ways: Certificates and
keys can be stored in the API Gateway keystore, or in a network or an
optional Hardware Security Module (HSM). For more details, see [Manage
X.509 certificates and keys](../CommonTopics/general_certificates.htm).

-   Connecting to Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) and XML Key
    Management Specification (XKMS) to query certificate status online.
-   Using a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) retrieved from a
    directory, file, or LDAP to check certificate status.
-   Checking a certificate chain.

Registries and repositories
---------------------------

API Gateway includes the following support for service registries and
repositories:

-   Architects and policy developers can use Policy Studio to pull Web
    service definitions (WSDL) from UDDI directories or HTTP-based
    repositories. These WSDL files are then used to generate the
    required security policies. The API Gateway can update UDDI
    registries with updated WSDL files or can serve them directly to the
    client. For more details, see the [API Gateway Policy Developer
    Guide](/bundle/APIGateway_77_PolicyDevGuide_allOS_en_HTML5/) .
-   When the API Manager product is installed, architects and policy
    developers can use Policy Studio to register REST APIs with the API
    Gateway. API administrators can then use API Manager to make these
    APIs available to client application developers in a Client
    Application Registry. For more details, see the [API Manager User
    Guide](/bundle/APIManager_77_APIMgmtGuide_allOS_en_HTML5/) .

Software Configuration Management
---------------------------------

The API Gateway does not include its own built-in Software Configuration
Management or Source Code Management (SCM) features. It is recommended
that you use your existing SCM tools to manage your API Gateway
configuration packages (`.fed`, `.pol`, and `.env` files) and API
Gateway policy or general configuration exports (`.xml` files). For
example, commonly used source code management tools include Concurrent
Version System (CVS), Subversion (SVN), and Git.

In addition, you can use the properties metadata associated with API
Gateway configuration packages (`.fed`, `.pol`, and `.env` files) to
associate version information with the packages that are provided to
upstream environments. You can also use the API Gateway Compare/Merge
features to determine changes between different configuration packages.

For more details on API Gateway configuration packages and their
properties metadata, see the [API Gateway DevOps Deployment
Guide](/bundle/APIGateway_77_PromotionGuide_allOS_en_HTML5/) . For
details on exporting API Gateway policies and general configuration, and
on Compare/Merge, see the [API Gateway Policy Developer
Guide](/bundle/APIGateway_77_PolicyDevGuide_allOS_en_HTML5/) .
